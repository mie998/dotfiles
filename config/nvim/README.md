### Neovim Config Wirtten in Lua 🏜

This is Neovim-Config Repository for my personal use.  
(Since 2023/3/9~)

This Repository has three Branches.  
- main
  - Almost empty branch(only README.md exists)
- coc
  - Neovim Configs based on Coc.nvim.(my daily-use settings)
- lsp
  - Neovim Configs based on Neovim-Builtin LSP.

You can choice favorite Branch(if you want to use)👐  

`$ git clone git@github.com:Nyowa450/nvim.git`

**This is my PERSONAL NEOVIM CONFIGS.**  
**If you use this Configs (especially in practice), BE CAREFUL.🚨**
